# Test PR Comments

This file was created to test the PR comment functionality.

The GitHub workflow should now:
1. Detect this is a PR-related build
2. Post an initial comment when deployment starts 
3. Update the comment when deployment completes (success/failure)

## Features Implemented:
- PR detection logic for both PR events and push events on PR branches
- Initial comment with deployment info and build log link
- Final comment update with success/failure status
- Proper URL generation for main vs feature branches
- Styled buttons for "View Log" and "Open Preview"
