# ImplementationGuide Publisher GitHub Action

This GitHub Action automatically builds and publishes FHIR Implementation Guides using the HL7 FHIR IG Publisher. It is designed to run the publisher on push or pull request events and publish the output to GitHub Pages.

## ðŸš€ Versioned Workflow with Hybrid Versioning Strategy

This repository provides a **single versioned workflow** that supports both stable v1 compatibility and v2 DAK features:

- **Stable Production (Recommended)**: Use commit SHA `@14b3859` for immutable v1 reference
- **Latest Development**: Use `@main` for cutting-edge features and improvements
- **DAK-Enhanced Builds**: Enable with `do_dak: true` parameter

### Recommended Usage (Stable)
```yaml
uses: WorldHealthOrganization/smart-base/.github/workflows/ghbuild.yml@14b3859
```

**ðŸ“– See [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md) for complete migration guide and best practices.**

## Quick Start

### For Standard FHIR IG Builds (Recommended - Stable)
```yaml
jobs:
  build: 
    uses: WorldHealthOrganization/smart-base/.github/workflows/ghbuild.yml@14b3859
```

### For Latest Development Features
```yaml
jobs:
  build: 
    uses: WorldHealthOrganization/smart-base/.github/workflows/ghbuild.yml@main
```

### For DAK-Enhanced Builds
```yaml
jobs:
  dak-build:
    uses: WorldHealthOrganization/smart-base/.github/workflows/ghbuild.yml@14b3859
    with:
      do_dak: true
```

### For Cutting-Edge DAK Features  
```yaml
jobs:
  dak-build:
    uses: WorldHealthOrganization/smart-base/.github/workflows/ghbuild.yml@main
    with:
      do_dak: true
```

## Features

- Default branch is published in `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>`. Branches are published in `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/branches/<branch>`
- Automatically uses the latest versions of sushi and IG publisher
- **Hybrid Versioning**: Use commit SHAs for stability (`@14b3859`) or branches for latest features (`@main`)
- **Conditional DAK Features**: Enable with `do_dak: true` parameter when needed
- **Self-contained**: Downloads DAK scripts automatically when DAK features are enabled

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this GitHub Action, you need to ensure the following:

- Your repository should have a branch called `gh-pages`.
- You have configured GitHub Pages to serve from the `gh-pages` branch.
- Write permissions are granted for workflows
- Your FHIR IG source files are properly set up in your repository.

## Setup

1. **Configure GitHub Pages**

   Make sure that GitHub Pages is enabled for your repository and is set to deploy from the `gh-pages` branch.

2. **Choose Your Workflow Version**

   **For production use (Recommended)**, use the stable commit reference:
   
   - **Standard FHIR IG**: Use `ghbuild.yml@14b3859`
   - **With DAK features**: Use `ghbuild.yml@14b3859` with `do_dak: true`
   - **Latest development**: Use `ghbuild.yml@main` (for testing new features)

3. **Add the Workflow File**

   Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository if it doesn't already exist, and add the workflow:

   **Standard FHIR build (Recommended - Stable)**:
   ```yaml
   name: Build IG
   on: [push, pull_request]
   jobs:
     build: 
       uses: WorldHealthOrganization/smart-base/.github/workflows/ghbuild.yml@14b3859
   ```
   
   **DAK-enhanced build (Recommended - Stable)**:
   ```yaml
   name: Build IG with DAK
   on: [push, pull_request]
   jobs:
     dak-build:
       uses: WorldHealthOrganization/smart-base/.github/workflows/ghbuild.yml@14b3859
       with:
         do_dak: true
   ```
   
   **Latest development features**:
   ```yaml
   name: Build IG (Latest)
   on: [push, pull_request]
   jobs:
     build: 
       uses: WorldHealthOrganization/smart-base/.github/workflows/ghbuild.yml@main
   ```

   See [example](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/smart-ig-starter-kit/blob/main/.github/workflows/ghbuild.yml).

4. **GitHub Token**

   This action uses the `GITHUB_TOKEN` provided by GitHub Actions, so you don't need to manually create one.

## Usage

The action is configured to run on push or pull requests to any branch except the `gh-pages` branch. It can also be triggered manually via the GitHub Actions tab.

### Workflow Triggers

- **Push to `main` branch**: When commits are pushed to the `main` branch, the IG Publisher is run, and the output is published to the root of the GitHub Pages site.
- **Push to other branches**: When commits are pushed to branches other than `main`, the output is published to a subdirectory named after the branch - branches/<vranch_name>
- **Pull Request**: The action will run to ensure that the IG Publisher can build the IG from the pull request, but will not deploy to GitHub Pages.
- **Manual Trigger**: You can manually trigger the workflow from the GitHub Actions tab if needed.

### What the Workflow Does

Here is a step-by-step description of the workflow:

1. **Checkout**: Checks out the repository code.
2. **Get the latest image of the IG publisher**: Downloads the latest `publisher.jar` from the official FHIR IG Publisher repository.
4. **Create package cache folder**: Creates a cache folder for the packages needed by the publisher.
5. **Run the IG publisher**: Executes the IG Publisher to generate the IG site files.
6. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**: Depending on the branch, deploys the output to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository.

### Notes

- The action is currently set up to keep a history of deployments for branches other than `main`. This can be changed by adjusting the `single-commit` and `clean` options in the workflow file.
