# gh-pages/branches Directory Cleanup

## Issue Summary

The `gh-pages/branches` directory has grown to **8.4GB** containing **1,578 items** (93,719+ files total). This directory contains historical builds from various feature branches and is consuming significant repository space, impacting clone and fetch performance.

**Issue Link**: [#150 - Depopulate gh-pages/branches](https://github.com/WorldHealthOrganization/smart-base/issues/150)

## Analysis Results

### Current State (Before Cleanup)
- **Directory Size**: 8.4GB
- **Number of Items**: 1,578 directories
- **Total Files**: 93,719+ files
- **Content**: Historical builds from branches like:
  - `fix-58-2`, `fix-54`, `v1`, `Persona`, `R5`, `updatescript`, `wfw`
  - Each containing complete IG builds with HTML, JSON, XML, TTL files
  - Duplicate content across multiple branch builds

### Target State (After Cleanup)
- **Directory Size**: 92KB (empty directory)
- **Number of Items**: 0
- **Total Files**: 0
- **Space Saved**: ~8.3GB

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Automated Cleanup Script

A comprehensive cleanup script has been created: `cleanup-gh-pages-branches.sh`

**Features:**
- ✅ Safety checks (git repository, branch existence)
- ✅ Size measurement before/after
- ✅ Comprehensive logging
- ✅ Automatic branch switching and restoration
- ✅ Detailed commit message with statistics
- ✅ Clear next steps for execution

### 2. Manual Steps Performed (Testing)

The cleanup has been successfully tested on the gh-pages branch:

```bash
# Results from test execution:
# - Switched to gh-pages branch
# - Removed 93,719 files from branches directory  
# - Reduced size from 8.4GB to 92KB
# - Created commit ce7eb99e with detailed documentation
# - Verified cleanup success
```

## Execution Instructions

### For Repository Maintainers

1. **Review the cleanup script**:
   ```bash
   cat cleanup-gh-pages-branches.sh
   ```

2. **Execute the cleanup** (requires push permissions to gh-pages):
   ```bash
   ./cleanup-gh-pages-branches.sh
   ```

3. **Review the changes**:
   ```bash
   git checkout gh-pages
   git show --stat
   ```

4. **Push the cleanup** (⚠️ **IRREVERSIBLE**):
   ```bash
   git push origin gh-pages
   ```

### Alternative: Manual Execution

If you prefer manual execution:

```bash
# 1. Switch to gh-pages branch
git checkout gh-pages

# 2. Check current size
du -sh branches
find branches -type f | wc -l

# 3. Remove all contents
rm -rf branches/*

# 4. Verify cleanup
du -sh branches
ls -la branches/

# 5. Commit changes
git add -A
git commit -m "Remove all content from gh-pages/branches directory

Resolves #150"

# 6. Push changes (⚠️ IRREVERSIBLE)
git push origin gh-pages
```

## Impact Assessment

### Repository Benefits
- **Significant size reduction**: ~8.3GB space saved
- **Improved performance**: Faster clones, fetches, and operations
- **Cleaner history**: Removes unnecessary historical artifacts
- **Better maintenance**: Easier to manage gh-pages content

### Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Only removes old build artifacts from branches
- **No functional impact**: Current main/production content unaffected
- **Reversible**: Branches can be rebuilt if needed through CI/CD
- **Backup available**: Git history preserves pre-cleanup state

## Technical Details

### Files Removed
The cleanup removes build artifacts including:
- HTML documentation files
- JSON/XML/TTL resource files  
- CSS/JS/image assets
- Excel/CSV export files
- PNG icon files
- Various metadata files

### Directories Cleaned
- `branches/fix-*` (various fix branches)
- `branches/v1` (version builds)
- `branches/Persona` (feature branch builds)
- `branches/R5` (FHIR R5 builds)
- `branches/updatescript` (script builds)
- `branches/wfw` (workflow builds)

## Verification Steps

After cleanup execution:

1. **Size verification**:
   ```bash
   du -sh branches  # Should show ~92KB
   ```

2. **Content verification**:
   ```bash
   ls -la branches/  # Should be empty
   ```

3. **Git verification**:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -1  # Should show cleanup commit
   ```

4. **Repository size check**:
   ```bash
   git count-objects -vH  # Should show reduced repository size
   ```

## Conclusion

This cleanup will dramatically improve the repository's performance and maintainability by removing 8.3GB of unnecessary historical build artifacts. The solution is safe, well-documented, and provides clear execution steps for repository maintainers.

The automated script ensures proper safety checks and detailed logging, making the cleanup process reliable and traceable.
