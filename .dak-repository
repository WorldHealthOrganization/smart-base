# WHO SMART Guidelines DAK Repository

This file serves as a lightweight marker to identify this repository as a WHO SMART Guidelines Digital Adaptation Kit (DAK) repository.

External tools can check for this file's existence using a GitHub API HEAD request, which is more efficient than a GET request and avoids downloading file content:

```bash
# Check if repository is a DAK repository (returns 200 if yes, 404 if no)
curl -I https://api.github.com/repos/WorldHealthOrganization/smart-base/contents/.dak-repository
```

For comprehensive DAK metadata, see the `dak.json` file in the repository root.
